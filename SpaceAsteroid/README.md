This game was developed by Xiaotian Zhang (20319043), and Yibo Sun (20320401). Our team's name is F2A, which came from StarCraft. Because of various reasons, like being caught in the sudden covid epidemic, Zhang has got a serious illness, but there are still some parts of our assumption not developed completely. We separate the source code into different parts. Fix several bugs in it. We extract some repeated codes and turned them into different functions.
We seperate the game into 6 stages, each stage has one contoller. And we initial the stages in one java file. We also extract some useful storeages out of source code to help later change or maintance on it.
In this work, Yibo Sun mainly covers adding new functions, building several stages, and writing JavaDoc. Xiaotian Zhang mainly covers fixing initial bugs, designing UI, and maintaining the git.
